# Expert-Systems-Program

Develop an expert system to determine if an applicant is qualified for available positions. 

An applicant will be asked to answer questions that the expert system will evaluate to determine what positions they are qualified for. The applicant will be shown a result:

Position(s) they are qualified for.
Position(s) they are not qualified and why.
